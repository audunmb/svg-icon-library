# svg-icon-library
Wordpress plugin that adds a custom SVG icon library to [The Icon Block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block) plugin, following the instructions [here](https://nickdiego.com/adding-custom-icons-to-the-icon-block/). 

The instructions described on the webpage says how to add it your to your theme, but this adds the icon library with a plugin instead.
